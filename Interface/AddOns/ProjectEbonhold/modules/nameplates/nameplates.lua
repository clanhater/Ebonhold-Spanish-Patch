-- nameplates.lua -- WoW-style nameplate reskin, retroported to 3.3.5.
--
-- The stock 3.3.5 nameplate (name + a bare health bar, small grey text, no
-- health value) is hard to read at a glance. This reskins it to look closer
-- to modern WoW: a bold name, an exact "12,345  68%" health readout, a level
-- badge (off by default) colored by difficulty, and a cast bar with the
-- spell's icon -- while staying readable at any UI scale, since every fill
-- AND border is a solid-color WHITE8X8 tint (see WHITE8X8 below and
-- BuildFlatBorderStrips) rather than a texture -- a textured border was
-- tried and shimmered visibly on a moving plate (sub-pixel sampling of
-- detail that isn't there in a flat color), confirmed live across multiple
-- textures and position fixes; not revisited.
--
-- Structure (verified against this exact client via ElvUI's WotLK nameplate
-- port, modules/Nameplates/Nameplates.lua:573-574 -- this is the real,
-- long-standing Blizzard NamePlateTemplate layout, not something specific to
-- this server):
--   plate:GetChildren() -> Health (StatusBar), CastBar (StatusBar)
--   plate:GetRegions()  -> Threat, Border, CastBarBorder, CastBarShield,
--                          CastBarIcon, Highlight, Name, Level, BossIcon,
--                          RaidIcon, EliteIcon
-- This client additionally sets plate.unit to a real resolvable unit token
-- (verified live, e.g. "nameplate1") -- not documented/expected for stock
-- 3.3.5, but present here, so UnitClass/UnitClassification/UnitCastingInfo/
-- UnitChannelInfo work for ANY plate, not just target/mouseover. The cast bar
-- is built from UnitCastingInfo/UnitChannelInfo(unit) rather than the native
-- CastBar widget -- nothing proves the engine drives that widget's value for
-- units other than target/mouseover (see GetUnitCastData). All Unit API
-- reads are wrapped in SafeCall and degrade gracefully if a specific plate's
-- token isn't resolvable at a given moment (e.g. right after creation).

-- ProjectEbonholdDB.nameplatesEnabled is already persisted as true on every

-- driver never starts: no WorldFrame scan, no overlays, no per-frame work at
-- all, and the client's own nameplates are left completely untouched.

-- To re-enable: set this to false. The optimisations below (throttled scan,
